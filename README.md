# clock_pic12f675
This project is an electronic clock designed to automatically display time using the PIC12F675 microcontroller and the DS1307 real-time clock module. The clock has the capability to show hours, minutes, and seconds on an LED display or a 7-segment display
## Key Features

- Display of hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Utilizes DS1307 for real-time clock functionality.
- Push buttons for setting hours and minutes.
- LED display or 7-segment display options.

## Circuit

The project employs the PIC12F675 to control the display and communicate with the DS1307 through the I2C interface. A circuit section is designed to connect to the display and push buttons.

## Usage Guide

1. **Set up Development Environment:**
   - Use a compiler and programmer for PIC to compile and program the PIC12F675.

2. **Assemble the Circuit:**
   - Assemble the circuit according to the provided circuit diagram.

3. **Program the Microcontroller:**
   - Load the program into the microcontroller using a programming tool.

4. **Use the Clock:**
   - Power on the circuit, and the clock will display hours, minutes, and seconds.
   - Use push buttons to set the desired hours and minutes.
